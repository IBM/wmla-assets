**What is Watson Machine Learning Accelerator?**

Watson Machine Learning Accelerator is an  Enterprise AI Infrastructure to make deep learning and machine learning more accessible to your staff, and brings the benefits of AI into your business.  It combines popular open source deep learning frameworks, efficient AI development tools, and available in both accelerated IBM® Power Systems™ servers and Intel servers.   Now your organization can deploy a fully optimized and supported AI platform that delivers blazing performance, proven dependability and resilience. Watson Machine Learning Accelerator is a complete environment for data science as a service, enabling your organization to bring AI applications into production.

&nbsp;

Data Scientists can accelerate their AI journey by scaling out their workload such as tuning their hyper-parameters,  and while sharing GPU resources in elastic manner with growing number of data scientists.      The following video will give you a great started and tell you "Why should you as Data Scientist care about Watson ML Accelerator?"

Now you have seen all key capabilities :).  Are you ready to get hands-on experience with our learning module series.   In near future we will introduce learning module per our key capabilities, including:

- Elastic Distribute Training
- Automated Hyperparamter Optimitization
- Accelerated ML library - SnapML
- Elastic Distributed Inference

These modules are independent and self-contained where you can learn on your own schedule.

Lets get started with the first learning module of ["Elastic Distributed Training"](https://github.com/IBM/wmla-assets/blob/master/WMLA-learning-journey/elastic-distributed-training-module/Elastic-Distributed-Training-Learning-Module.md)
