# Train Keras and MLlib models within a Watson Machine Learning Accelerator custom notebook

> These assets are for the tutorial here: https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/training-keras-and-mllib-model-with-watson-machine-learning-accelerator/

This repo contains the following:

* `PowerAI-1.5.4.2-Notebook-Base.tar.gz`

  This is a Power AI Enterprise (PAIE) notebook package that requires customization to be installed on PAIE.

* `tf_keras_fashion_mnist.ipynb`

  This is a Jupyter notebook for running the Tensorflow Keras Fashion MNIST model.

* `hadoop_livy2_spark_mllib_test.ipynb`

  This is a Jupyter notebook for running sparkmagic to create a connection to a Livy server running on a Hadoop / Spark cluster. A Spark MLlib model is executed on the remote cluster.
