# Guide To Samples
The samples are listed from simplest to more involved. If this is the first time for you, we suggest to start with **mnist_convnet**; otherwise, just pick the ones with titles and descriptions closest to what you are trying to do. For each sample, there is a README.md file with the details how to run the sample, as well as a **self-test.sh** which autotmates the instructions.
