# Configure a system for deep learning in IBM Watson Machine Learning Accelerator 1.2.3

Several of the deep learning frameworks require Anaconda, which is a data science distribution that can be used on any platform. IBM Watson Machine Learning Accelerator (WML Accelerator) 1.2.3 requires you to set up the required Anaconda environment and deep learning frameworks. The available conda script installs the correct version of Anaconda and any dependent packages and deep learning frameworks.
