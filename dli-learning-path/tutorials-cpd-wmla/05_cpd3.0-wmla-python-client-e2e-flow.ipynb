    "Using the Watson Machine Learning API Python client library. You will learn to download a sample Pytorch MNIST model and train it using Watson Machine Learning Accelerator (WMLA) to identify numbers based on images. Then, you will save and deploy the model from your workspace and again use WML to score it. Lastly you will clean up by deleting your deployment. This notebook runs on Python 3.6 and is intended for CPD 3.0.1.\n",
